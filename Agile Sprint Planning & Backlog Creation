Product Vision Statement:
The Blues Trainer App is designed for individuals who are actively developing a skill independently, such as musicians, athletes, students, or hobbyists who rely on self-directed practice. These users often lack structured feedback, accountability, and measurable progress tracking, which makes it difficult to maintain motivation and understand whether their effort is producing meaningful improvement. Without a centralized system, practice sessions become fragmented, progress is difficult to quantify, and users may lose consistency over time.

This application solves that problem by providing a structured platform where users can log practice sessions, track performance accuracy, visualize long-term progress, and receive feedback driven by data analysis and machine learning. It provides value by transforming practice from an unstructured activity into a measurable, goal-oriented process. Users gain visibility into their growth through analytics, accuracy scoring, streak tracking, and personalized suggestions. This increases consistency, improves skill development efficiency, and reinforces motivation by making progress observable and actionable.

2. Initial Product Backlog
Create an initial backlog of at least 8–12 items.

[HIGH] User Account Registration

[HIGH] User Login and Authentication
Description: Allow users to log in securely and maintain authenticated sessions using token-based authentication.

[HIGH] Database Schema Setup
Description: Design and implement PostgreSQL database structure for users, practice sessions, and performance metrics.

[HIGH] Practice Session Logging System
Description: Allow users to create, edit, and delete practice session records including duration, notes, and activity type.

[HIGH] Basic Dashboard Interface
Description: Create frontend dashboard showing total practice time, recent sessions, and summary information.

[HIGH] Backend API Foundation
Description: Create REST API endpoints for authentication, session logging, and data retrieval.

[MEDIUM] Progress Analytics Integration
Description: Integrate analytics API to calculate accuracy trends, performance metrics, and progression data.

[MEDIUM] Audio Processing Integration
Description: Integrate audio processing API to analyze pitch, tempo, and accuracy from recorded input.

[MEDIUM] Data Visualization System
Description: Implement charts and graphs showing performance trends over time.

[MEDIUM] Streak Tracking System
Description: Track consecutive practice days and display streak statistics.

[MEDIUM] Cloud Deployment Setup
Description: Configure Docker containerization and deploy application to Google Cloud.

[LOW] Testing Framework Implementation
Description: Create automated tests for backend APIs and frontend functionality.

3. User Stories (Minimum: 5)
As a user, I want to create an account so that my practice data can be securely stored and accessed later.

As a user, I want to log my practice sessions so that I can track consistency and total time spent practicing.

As a user, I want to view my progress over time so that I can see measurable improvement and maintain motivation.

As a user, I want the system to analyze my audio input so that I can receive objective feedback on accuracy and performance.

As a user, I want to view a dashboard summary so that I can quickly understand my current performance and practice trends.

As a user, I want personalized suggestions so that I can improve practice efficiency and focus on weak areas.
4. Sprint Plan (Sprint 1)
Sprint Duration:
2 weeks

Sprint Goal:
Establish the foundational infrastructure required for user authentication, data storage, and basic practice session logging functionality.

Sprint Backlog Items Selected:

User Account Registration

User Login & Session Management

Database Schema Setup

Practice Session Logging

Dashboard UI (Basic version)

Justification:
These items are essential to establish the core system architecture. Without authentication, database infrastructure, and logging capability, the application cannot function. Practice logging is the central feature of the system, and the dashboard provides immediate user value by displaying stored data. Analytics, AI integration, and advanced APIs depend on this foundational infrastructure and therefore must follow after these components are operational.

5. Team Roles and Responsibilities
Product Owner — Colin Greenwood
Responsible for defining the application concept, user requirements, feature priorities, and overall product direction. Colin establishes the vision of what the application needs to accomplish and ensures development aligns with the intended purpose and user needs.

Scrum Master — Aaron Eddy
Responsible for organizing development workflow, planning sprint structure, managing technical execution timelines, and ensuring development progresses efficiently. Oversees implementation structure and ensures technical feasibility of planned features.

Lead Developer / Implementation — Colin Greenwood
Responsible for backend architecture, frontend development, database implementation, API integration, system deployment, and technical problem solving. Converts the conceptual design and requirements into a working system.

System Design and Feature Direction — Aaron Eddy
Responsible for defining how the user interacts with the system, identifying core feature requirements, and refining application functionality from the user perspective.
6. Reflection (Individual Paragraphs)
The most challenging part of Agile for this project will be maintaining consistent iteration and clear coordination between conceptual design and technical implementation. Since Colin is responsible for defining the application vision and I am responsible for making it function technically, there must be continuous alignment between requirements and feasibility. Without structured communication, it would be easy to implement systems that technically work but do not fully match the intended user experience.

Agile practices reduce project failure by enforcing incremental development, clear priorities, and continuous validation of functionality. By building core infrastructure first and expanding in controlled stages, the system remains stable and scalable. Sprint planning ensures that development remains focused on essential components rather than attempting to implement advanced features prematurely.

Agile also ensures accountability and structured progress. By clearly separating product direction and technical execution roles, development remains organized and efficient. This structure allows the application to evolve in a controlled manner while maintaining alignment between system functionality and intended purpose.
