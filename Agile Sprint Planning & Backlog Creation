Product Vision Statement:
Provide a short vision statement (1–2 paragraphs) that answers:

Who is the product for?

What problem does it solve?

What value does it provide?

This should be understandable to a non-technical stakeholder.

2. Initial Product Backlog
Create an initial backlog of at least 8–12 items.

Each backlog item should include:

A short title

A brief description

Priority (High / Medium / Low)

Backlog items may include:

Features

Technical tasks

Infrastructure or setup work

Testing or documentation tasks

3. User Stories (Minimum: 5)
Write at least five user stories using the standard Agile format:

As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some benefit].
Each user story should:

Be clear and testable

Represent meaningful functionality

Be small enough to complete within a sprint

4. Sprint Plan (Sprint 1)
Define your first sprint:

Sprint duration (e.g., 1 or 2 weeks)

Sprint goal (1–2 sentences)

3–5 backlog items selected for the sprint

Brief justification for why these items were chosen first

Focus on foundational progress, not perfection.

5. Team Roles and Responsibilities
Identify who is responsible for:

Coordinating work (Scrum Master–like role)

Managing priorities (Product Owner–like role)

Implementation tasks

Roles may rotate later, but must be defined now.

6. Reflection (Individual Paragraphs)
Each group member must contribute a short individual reflection answering:

What part of Agile do you think will be most challenging for this project?

How will Agile practices help reduce project failure?

Solo students should reflect on how they will simulate feedback and iteration.
