The problem in the modern guitar world is that very few apps focus on core fundamentals of guitar and blues. The blues originated among African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the 1860, but took off in the 1950's. Blues has been around for years and provides the back bone of western pop, rock, country, and others. Learning the blues is as fundmental as it gets.
