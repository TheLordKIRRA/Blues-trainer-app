Final Project Proposal – Personal Practice Tracker Web Application
I will build a Personal Practice Tracker web application to help users build consistent habits in skill-based activities. The app provides structure, accountability, and visual progress feedback to address challenges in maintaining motivation as measurable progress slows.
Target users include students, hobbyists, musicians, athletes, and anyone practicing independently without formal guidance. With this application, users benefit from simple tools that log in sessions, track goals, and provide meaningful feedback, making it easier for them to see how their daily efforts contribute directly to their long-term growth.
Core features will include:
• Secure user login and a personalized practice dashboard
• Daily/weekly habit and session logging
• Progress analytics with charts and trend visualizations
• Optional reminders, streak tracking, and motivational prompts
The technology stack will include a React frontend, a Python Flask or Node.js backend, a PostgreSQL database, and containerization with Docker. The application will be deployed to the Google Cloud Platform with CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions. AI integration will provide personalized practice suggestions by analyzing user patterns and past session performance.
